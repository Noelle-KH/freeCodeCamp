            <strong>Flexbox</strong> is a one-dimensional layout method for
            arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill
            additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article
            explains all the fundamentals.

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools
            available for creating CSS layouts were features like
            <strong>floats</strong> and <strong> positioning</strong>. These
            work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following simple layout designs are either difficult or
            impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient,
            flexible way:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
            <li>
              Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of
              the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is
              available.
            </li>
            <li>
              Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same
              height even if they contain a different amount of content.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout
            tasks much easier. Let's dig in!
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section
        class="main-section"
        id="Specifying_what_elements_to_lay_out_as_flexible_boxes"
      >
        <header>
          <h2>Specifying what elements to lay out as flexible boxes</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid out
            as flexible boxes. To do this, we set a special value of
            <strong>display</strong> on the parent element of the elements you
            want to affect. In this case we want to lay out the
            <strong>article</strong> elements, so we set this on the
            <strong>section</strong>:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>section {</code>
              <span class="indent">display: flex;</span>
            <code>}</code> 
          </pre>
          <p>
            This causes the <strong>section</strong> element to become a flex
            container and its children to become flex items.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, this single declaration gives us everything we need. Incredible,
            right? We have our multiple column layout with equal-sized columns,
            and the columns are all the same height. This is because the default
            values given to flex items (the children of the flex container) are
            set up to solve common problems such as this.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be clear, let's reiterate what is happening here. The element
            we've given a <strong>display</strong> value of
            <strong>flex</strong> to is acting like a block-level element in
            terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page, but its
            children are laid out as flex items. The next section will explain
            in more detail what this means. Note also that you can use a
            <strong>display</strong> value of <strong>inline-flex</strong> if
            you wish to lay out an element's children as flex items, but have
            that element behave like an inline element.
          </p>

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along
            two axes
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items
              are laid out in (for example, as rows across the page, or columns
              down the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the main
              start and main end.
            </li>
            <li>
              The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction
              the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are
              called the cross start and cross end.
            </li>
            <li>
              The parent element that has <strong>display: flex</strong> set on
              it (the <strong>section</strong> in our example) is called the
              flex container.
            </li>
            <li>
              The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are
              called flex items (the <strong>article</strong> elements in our
              example).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Bear this terminology in mind as you go through subsequent sections.
            You can always refer back to it if you get confused about any of the
            terms being used.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Columns_or_rows?">

        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Flexbox provides a property called
            <strong>flex-direction</strong> that specifies which direction the
            main axis runs (which direction the flexbox children are laid out
            in). By default this is set to <strong>row</strong>, which causes
            them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default
            language works in (left to right, in the case of an English
            browser).
          </p>
          <p>
            Try adding the following declaration to your
            <strong>section</strong> rule:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>flex-direction:</code> <span>column;</span>
          </pre>
          <p>
            You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much
            like they were before we added any CSS. Before you move on, delete
            this declaration from your example.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Wrapping">

        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your
            layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their
            container, breaking the layout. Have a look at our
            <a
              href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html"
              target="_blank"
            >
              flexbox-wrap0.html</a
            >
            example and try
            <a
              href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html"
              target="_blank"
              >viewing it live
            </a>
            (take a local copy of this file now if you want to follow along with
            this example):
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their
            container. One way in which you can fix this is to add the following
            declaration to your <strong>section</strong> rule:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>flex-wrap:</code> <span>wrap;</span>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Also, add the following declaration to your
            <strong>article</strong> rule:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>flex:</code> <span>200px;</span>
          </pre>
          <p>
            We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children
            fitted into it as is sensible. Any overflow is moved down to the
            next line. The <strong>flex: 200px</strong> declaration set on the
            articles means that each will be at least 200px wide. We'll discuss
            this property in more detail later on. You might also notice that
            the last few children on the last row are each made wider so that
            the entire row is still filled.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your
            <strong>flex-direction</strong> property value to
            <strong>row-reverse</strong>. Now you'll see that you still have
            your multiple row layout, but it starts from the opposite corner of
            the browser window and flows in reverse.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="flex-flow_shorthand">
        <header>
          <h2>flex-flow shorthand</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            At this point it's worth noting that a shorthand exists for
            <strong>flex-direction</strong> and
            <strong> flex-wrap: flex-flow</strong>. So, for example, you can
            replace
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>flex-direction:</code> <span>row;</span>
            <code>flex-wrap:</code> <span>wrap;</span>
          </pre>
          <p>with</p>
          <pre>
            <code>flex-flow:</code> <span>row wrap;</span>
          </pre>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Flexible_sizing_of_flex_items">
        <header>
          <h2>Flexible sizing of flex items</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Let's now return to our first example and look at how we can control
            what proportion of space flex items take up compared to the other
            flex items. Fire up your local copy of
            <a
              href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html"
              target="_blank"
              >flexbox0.html</a
            >, or take a copy of
            <a
              href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html"
              target="_blank"
              >flexbox1.html</a
            >
            as a new starting point (<a
              href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html"
              target="_blank"
              >see it live</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>article {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 1;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much available
            space along the main axis each flex item will take up compared to
            other flex items. In this case, we're giving each
            <strong>article</strong> element the same value (a value of 1),
            which means they'll all take up an equal amount of the spare space
            left after properties like padding and margin have been set. This
            value is proportionally shared among the flex items: giving each
            flex item a value of 400000 would have exactly the same effect.
          </p>
          <p>Now add the following rule below the previous one:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>article:nth-of-type(3) {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 2;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third
            <strong>article</strong> takes up twice as much of the available
            width as the other two. There are now four proportion units
            available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4). The first two flex items
            have one unit each, so they each take 1/4 of the available space.
            The third one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the available
            space (or one-half).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also specify a minimum size value within the flex value. Try
            updating your existing article rules like so:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>article {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 1 200px;</span>
            <code>}</code>

            <code>article:nth-of-type(3) {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 2 200px;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This basically states, "Each flex item will first be given 200px of
            the available space. After that, the rest of the available space
            will be shared according to the proportion units." Try refreshing
            and you'll see a difference in how the space is shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real value of flexbox can be seen in its
            flexibility/responsiveness. If you resize the browser window or add
            another <strong>article</strong> element, the layout continues to
            work just fine.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="flex:_shorthand_versus_longhand">

        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            <strong>flex</strong> is a shorthand property that can specify up to
            three different values:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The unitless proportion value we discussed above. This can be
              specified separately using the <strong>flex-grow</strong> longhand
              property.
            </li>
            <li>
              A second unitless proportion value, <strong>flex-shrink</strong>,
              which comes into play when the flex items are overflowing their
              container. This value specifies how much an item will shrink in
              order to prevent overflow. This is quite an advanced flexbox
              feature and we won't be covering it any further in this article.
            </li>
            <li>
              The minimum size value we discussed above. This can be specified
              separately using the <strong>flex-basis</strong> longhand value.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We'd advise against using the longhand flex properties unless you
            really have to (for example, to override something previously set).
            They lead to a lot of extra code being written, and they can be
            somewhat confusing.

            You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the main
            or cross axis. Let's explore this by looking at a new example:
            <a
              href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html"
            >
              flex-align0.html</a
            >
            (<a
              href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html"
              >see it live also</a
            >
            ). We're going to turn this into a neat, flexible button/toolbar. At
            the moment you'll see a horizontal menu bar with some buttons jammed
            into the top left-hand corner.
          </p>
          <p>First, take a local copy of this example.</p>
          <p>Now, add the following to the bottom of the example's CSS:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>div {</code>
              <span class="indent">display: flex;</span>
              <span class="indent">align-items: center;</span>
              <span class="indent">justify-content: space-around;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Refresh the page and you'll see that the buttons are now nicely
            centered horizontally and vertically. We've done this via two new
            properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>align-items</strong> controls where the flex items sit on
            the cross axis.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              By default, the value is <strong>stretch</strong>, which stretches
              all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross
              axis. If the parent doesn't have a fixed height in the cross axis
              direction, then all flex items will become as tall as the tallest
              flex item. This is how our first example had columns of equal
              height by default.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>center</strong> value that we used in our above code
              causes the items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be
              centered along the cross axis. This is why our current example's
              buttons are centered vertically.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also have values like <strong>flex-start</strong> and
              <strong>flex-end</strong>, which will align all items at the start
              and end of the cross axis respectively. See
              <strong>align-items</strong> for the full details.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can override the <strong>align-items</strong> behavior for
            individual flex items by applying the
            <strong>align-self</strong> property to them. For example, try
            adding the following to your CSS:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>button:first-child {</code>
              <span class="indent">align-self: flex-end;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Have a look at what effect this has and remove it again when you've
            finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>justify-content</strong> controls where the flex items sit
            on the main axis.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The default value is flex-start, which makes all the items sit at
              the start of the main axis.
            </li>
            <li>You can use flex-end to make them sit at the end.</li>
            <li>
              center is also a value for justify-content. It'll make the flex
              items sit in the center of the main axis.
            </li>
            <li>
              The value we've used above, space-around, is useful — it
              distributes all the items evenly along the main axis with a bit of
              space left at either end.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is another value, space-between, which is very similar to
              space-around except that it doesn't leave any space at either end.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The <strong>justify-items</strong> property is ignored in flexbox
            layouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'd like to encourage you to play with these values to see how they
            work before you continue.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Ordering_flex_items">

          <p>
            Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex
            items without affecting the source order. This is another thing that
            is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code for this is simple. Try adding the following CSS to your
            button bar example code:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>button:first-child {</code>
              <span class="indent">order: 1;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Refresh and you'll see that the "Smile" button has moved to the end
            of the main axis. Let's talk about how this works in a bit more
            detail:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>By default, all flex items have an order value of 0.</li>
            <li>
              Flex items with higher specified <strong>order</strong> values
              will appear later in the display order than items with lower order
              values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source
              order. So if you have four items whose order values have been set
              as 2, 1, 1, and 0 respectively, their display order would be 4th,
              2nd, 3rd, then 1st.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order
              value and is after it in the source order.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than
            items whose value is 0. For example, you could make the "Blush"
            button appear at the start of the main axis using the following
            rule:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>button:last-child {</code>
              <span class="indent">order: -1;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Nested_flex_boxes">

          <h2>Nested flex boxes</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            It's possible to create some pretty complex layouts with flexbox.
            It's perfectly OK to set a flex item to also be a flex container, so
            that its children are also laid out like flexible boxes. Have a look
            at
            <a

          </p>
          <p>
            The HTML for this is fairly simple. We've got a
            <strong>section</strong> element containing three
            <strong>article</strong>s. The third
            <strong>article</strong> contains three <strong>div</strong>s, and
            the first <strong>div</strong> contains five
            <strong>button</strong>s.
          </p>
          <p>Let's look at the code we've used for the layout.</p>
          <p>
            First of all, we set the children of the <strong>section</strong> to
            be laid out as flexible boxes.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>section {</code>
              <span class="indent">display: flex;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Next, we set some flex values on the <strong>article</strong>s
            themselves. Take special note of the second rule here: we're setting
            the third <strong>article</strong> to have its children laid out
            like flex items too, but this time we're laying them out like a
            column.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>article {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 1 200px;</span>
            <code>}</code>

            <code>article:nth-of-type(3) {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 3 200px;</span>
              <span class="indent">display: flex;</span>
              <span class="indent">flex-flow: column;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Next, we select the first <strong>div</strong>. We first use flex: 1
            100px; to effectively give it a minimum height of 100px, then we set
            its children (the <strong>button</strong> elements) to also be laid
            out like flex items. Here we lay them out in a wrapping row and
            align them in the center of the available space as we did with the
            individual button example we saw earlier.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>article:nth-of-type(3) div:first-child {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 1 100px;</span>
              <span class="indent">display: flex;</span>
              <span class="indent">flex-flow: row wrap;</span>
              <span class="indent">align-items: center;</span>
              <span class="indent">justify-content: space-around;</span>
            <code>}</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Finally, we set some sizing on the button. This time by giving it a
            flex value of 1 auto. This has a very interesting effect, which
            you'll see if you try resizing your browser window width. The
            buttons will take up as much space as they can. As many will fit on
            a line as is comfortable; beyond that, they'll drop to a new line.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>button {</code>
              <span class="indent">flex: 1 auto;</span>
              <span class="indent">margin: 5px;</span>
              <span class="indent">font-size: 18px;</span>
              <span class="indent">line-height: 1.5;</span>
            <code>}</code>

            Flexbox support is available in most new browsers: Firefox, Chrome,
            Opera, Microsoft Edge, and IE 11, newer versions of Android/iOS,
            etc. However, you should be aware that there are still older
            browsers in use that don't support Flexbox (or do, but support a
            really old, out-of-date version of it.)

          <p>
            While you're just learning and experimenting, this doesn't matter
            too much; however, if you're considering using flexbox in a real
            website, you need to do testing and make sure that your user
            experience is still acceptable in as many browsers as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flexbox is a bit trickier than some CSS features. For example, if a
            browser is missing a CSS drop shadow, then the site will likely
            still be usable. Not supporting flexbox features, however, will
            probably break a layout completely, making it unusable.

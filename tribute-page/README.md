## Thought

I felt dissatisfied when I finished it for the first time. I made adjustments to the layout and content after the forum seniors gave feedback and suggested the reference website [Wizarding World](https://www.wizardingworld.com/), and now I feel much more comfortable. It's glad to have the courage to ask the seniors on the forum and get great feedback, and it's nice to make the project look better.
